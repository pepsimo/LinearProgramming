Modeling and Solving Linear Programming with R

This repository is the companion of the Modeling and solving linear programming with R
Here you will find the code of the CPLEX function, that returns the solution of a linear model written in CPLEX format.
We hope that this will be useful to all people interested in applying linear programming and solving models using open source software.
